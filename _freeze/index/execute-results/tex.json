Their method used bilateral trade data to identify the network structure of countries and the products they export and built on the concept of relatedness introduced in @hidalgo2007. Economic complexity has been shown to be a positive predictor of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and GDP growth. Increasing economic complexity has also been shown to decrease unemployment and increase employment @adam2023, reduce green house gas emissions @romero2021 and reduce income inequality @hartmann2017.\n\nRelatedness has since been applied across industry [@neffke2012], research areas [@guevara2016], occupation [@muneepeerakul2013] and technology (patents) [@kogler2013].\n\nThe relatedness approach has also been used to quantify economic complexity across cities, states, and regions, using employment data[@ecus, @ecnz, @ecmexico], business counts[@ecchina], patent classifications [@balland2021], and interstate and international trade data [@ecaus].\n\nDespite differences in data sources, the method for calculating economic complexity in the literature is relatively standard. The presence of an activity in a region is often identified using a location quotient method, such that an activity is said to be present in a region if:\n\n$$\\frac{X_a^r/\\sum_{a}X_a^r}{\\sum_{r}X_a^r/\\sum_{r,a}X_a^r} \\geq 1$$\n\nWhere $X$ is the measure of an activity $a$ in region $r$ - such as the level of employment in an occupation in a city, or the number of businesses classified in an industry in a province, or the value of exports of a product from a country. The location quotient method creates a binary matrix $M$ with $a$ rows and $r$ columns.\n\n### Regional economic complexity of small areas\n\nThe location quotient method can be unreliable due to the discontinuity at 1. This is especially relevant when economic complexity is calculated in regional areas where either $X_a^r$ or $\\frac{\\sum_{r}X_a^r}{\\sum_{r,a}X_a^r}$ are small. In these cases, small changes, or measurement error in $X_a^r$ can significantly change the location quotient.\n\nThe choice of region size and activity classification is important. In a study of the economic complexity of US regions, @ecus use metropolitan areas as the basis for calculations. Metropolitan areas in the United States are defined such that jobs within a given area are held by residents who live in that area.Metropolitan areas have a population of at least 50,000 people. The smallest MSA was estimated to have a 2023 population of 57,700 (about 0.015% of US population). They find a poor correlation between ECI calculated at higher level aggregated industry classifications indicating the importance of a high degree of disaggregation to provide as much information to the model as possible @ecus.\n\nIn New Zealand, @ecnz use weighted correlations of local employment shares. Regions range from a population of 1,434 to 573,150 with a mean population of 29,947 and median population of 6,952. Employment is measured as an industry-occupation pair.\n\n-   Differences in relationship between complexity and relatedness on indicators may be entirely context dependent.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n### Data\n\n-   Calculate economic complexity indicators for Australian regions using employment data from the 2021 Census.\n\n-   Regions classified by Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3)\n\n-   Economic activity classified by ANZSIC industry division and ANZSCO major group\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.4     v readr     2.1.5\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.1\nv ggplot2   3.5.1     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.3     v tidyr     1.3.1\nv purrr     1.0.2     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(strayr)\nlibrary(economiccomplexity)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'economiccomplexity'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    density\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n#StandWithUkraine\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLinking to GEOS 3.12.1, GDAL 3.8.4, PROJ 9.3.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tmap)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'tmap'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    rivers\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(spdep)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLoading required package: spData\nTo access larger datasets in this package, install the spDataLarge\npackage with: `install.packages('spDataLarge',\nrepos='https://nowosad.github.io/drat/', type='source')`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npow <- read_csv(\"data/sa3-pow-occp-indp-1-digit.csv\",\n                skip = 9,\n                n_max = 99360,\n                col_select = c(sa3 = \"SA3 (POW)\",\n                               anzsic_division = \"1-digit level INDP Industry of Employment\",\n                               anzsco_major = \"1-digit level OCCP Occupation\",\n                               count = Count)) |> \n  filter(!anzsic_division %in% c(\"Inadequately described\", \"Not stated\",\n                                 \"Not applicable\", \"Total\"),\n         !anzsco_major %in% c(\"Inadequately described\", \"Not stated\",\n                              \"Not applicable\", \"Total\"),\n         sa3 != \"Total\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nNew names:\n* `` -> `...6`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,\ne.g.:\n  dat <- vroom(...)\n  problems(dat)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nRows: 99360 Columns: 4\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): 1-digit level OCCP Occupation, SA3 (POW), 1-digit level INDP Indust...\ndbl (1): Count\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nregions <- pow |> \n  group_by(x = str_detect(sa3, \"POW|Migratory\")) |>  \n  summarise(count = sum(count)) |> \n  mutate(p = count/sum(count),\n         x = ifelse(!x, \"included\", \"excluded\")) |> \n  split(f = ~x)\n\npow_clean <- pow |> \n  filter(!str_detect(sa3, \"POW|Migratory\")) |> \n  mutate(anzsic_division = fct_inorder(anzsic_division),\n         anzsco_major = fct_inorder(anzsco_major), \n         industry_occupation = paste0(anzsic_division, \" (\", anzsco_major,\")\"),\n         industry_occupation = fct_inorder(industry_occupation)) |> \n  group_by(sa3, industry_occupation) |> \n  summarise(count = sum(count),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |> \n  group_by(sa3) |> \n  mutate(sa3_size = sum(count)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  group_by(industry_occupation) |> \n  mutate(industry_occupation_size = sum(count)) |> \n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   We exclude individuals who identify their place of work as a Migratory - Offshore - Shipping region or as No Fixed Address.
